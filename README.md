# UWO-Open-Seat-Detector
Selenium, bs4, and Twilio integrated Python script to check/notify me when a desired seat for a course opens at my university

Detailed ReadMe coming shortly :)

First i must the program automated such that it allows for any user to be notified over SMS about a couse seat opening provided that the program has the course ID. Right now, it only works on the first table returned in the search query, but what if there are multiple tables?...
