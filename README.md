# UWO-Open-Seat-Detector
Twilio integrated Python script to check/notify me when a desired seat for a course opens at my university. Program Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 for webscraping. This application is meant to be used as a Cron job.

# Motivation
My main reason for creating this script was to:

- Learn Webscraping libraries
- Learn how API SMS/SMTP communication works
- Solve a problem I had...

I wanted to take a course over the summmer at my university but the course had reached full capacity. I figured I couldn't keep checking the website for an open spot as the possiblility of a seat opening up and disappearing without my knowledge (in a span of say, 5-10 minutes) was a likely possiblity. I therefore decided to automate the process!
